## 中文

這個倉庫**不含** Mili《world.execute(me);》的音頻,也不含歌詞。兩樣都請自備,放進這個資料夾;git 會忽略這裡除了本說明以外的所有檔案。

| 檔案 | 預設檔名(`config.json → paths`) | 說明 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 歌曲 | `Mili - world.execute (me) ;.wav` | 檔名不同就改 `config.json → paths.audio`。製作時用的是 44.1 kHz 的 wav;你的版本若開頭的空白長度不同,用 `config.json → timing.offset` 整體校正。 |
| 歌詞 | `Mili - world.execute (me) ;.lrc` | 任何時間軸的 LRC,或沒有時間軸的純文字都可以;這個資料夾裡只有一個 `.lrc` / `.txt` 時,檔名不拘。 |

歌詞檔只需要有同樣的詞、同樣的順序。它自己的時間軸和分行不會被採用:`tools/fill_lyrics.mjs` 會把你的詞填進倉庫裡的時間表
(`data/lyric_timing.json`),生成只留在你本機的 `data/lyrics.json`。預覽、導出與分鏡表都會自動做這一步;想單獨看結果:

```bash
npm run lyrics
```

它會告訴你有幾行與製作時的歌詞完全相同、哪些行被重新分行、你的檔案裡哪幾列不是片中的歌詞(署名、翻譯)而被略過;
如果片中有某幾行在你的檔案裡找不到,它會列出行號與歌曲時間,並停下來。

沒有音檔時預覽仍然可以無聲播放(頁面下方的 `sound` 一行會說明原因);導出影片則一定需要音檔。

## English

This repository contains **neither** the audio of Mili's "world.execute(me);" **nor** its lyrics. Bring both yourself and put
them into this folder (its name means "audio & lyrics"); git ignores everything here except this note.

| File | Default name (`config.json → paths`) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Song | `Mili - world.execute (me) ;.wav` | If your file has another name, change `config.json → paths.audio`. The film was made with a 44.1 kHz wav; if your version has a different amount of silence at the start, shift everything with `config.json → timing.offset`. |
| Lyrics | `Mili - world.execute (me) ;.lrc` | An LRC with any timing, or plain text without time tags. If this folder holds exactly one `.lrc` / `.txt`, its name does not matter. |

The lyric file only has to carry the same words in the same order. Its own time tags and line breaks are not used:
`tools/fill_lyrics.mjs` puts your words into the timing table of the repository (`data/lyric_timing.json`) and writes
`data/lyrics.json`, which stays on your machine. The preview, the exporter and the storyboard do this by themselves; to see the result on its own:

```bash
npm run lyrics
```

It reports how many lines are identical to the text the film was made with, which lines were re-divided, and which rows of your
file are no line of the film (credits, translations) and were passed over. If lines of the film cannot be found in your file,
it lists their numbers and song times and stops.

Without an audio file the preview still plays, silently (the `sound` line under the picture says why); exporting a video does need the audio.
