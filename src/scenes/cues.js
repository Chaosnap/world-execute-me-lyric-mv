// CUES (v4): every time in the film that is NOT simply a beat, a half-beat or a bar line, in ONE place.
// The lyrics have line times only, and nobody building this could hear the song: these are the times of single words
// and syllables inside a line, and of drum hits that do not sit on the grid.
//
//   name: [seconds (song time), source, note]
//     source 'measured' = a STRONG onset found in the audio next to the brief's value (tools/measure_cues.py: vocal band
//                         300-3400 Hz; strength 0.75 or more of the scale). The measured time itself, not snapped: these
//                         are events inside a shot. Weaker onsets are too dense here to tell one syllable from the next,
//                         so those cues keep the brief's value and are marked 'initial': they are the ones to check by ear.
//            'audit'    = measured by the v3 audit (docs/v4/maps/*.json), taken over as it stands
//            'initial'  = the value the brief gave ("about ..."); no clear onset was found, or not measured yet
//            'analysis' = (fix round) found by the user's audio analysis: the part common to both channels (the voice is
//                         centred), its sustained component, energy in 1100-2900 Hz, where the vowel of a letter's name is
//                         bright and the function word before it is not. Not yet checked by ear.
//
// TO CORRECT A CUE BY EAR: change the number here and nowhere else (and set its source to 'ear').
// One cue per line; tools/measure_cues.py reads this file and prints what it finds next to each value.
// Sections read a cue with cue('name'). Cuts sit on the grid (kit.js cues()) and are not taken from here, with one
// exception: verse 2 cuts into its plates on the nouns, at these times snapped to the half-beat grid (features.snapHalf).
