// Section 10 — EXECUTION, the twelve shouts (bar 80, 2:28.0 → beat 344, 2:39.1). State: error. A CODE picture.
//
// The music here is twelve identical two-beat cells, so the picture is ONE machine in ONE composition: the love
// loop (loop.js) turning twelve times. No chat interface, no figure, and the ground stays the dark of the error
// state throughout (v3 jumped between dark, red and cream fields and re-placed the word in every shot).
//
//   the word is four even syllables (beats N, N+0.5, N+1, N+1.5 of every round):
//     they are the four statements of the loop body: the execution bar moves down lines 02-05
//     and the four blocks its big letters are printed solid in, bottom right, always in the same place
//   lines 02, 03, 04 raise the same three errors every round (all three were raised in the error section)
//   line 05 counts the round (a counter with no total); the arrow from line 06 back to 01 lights at every turn
//   every finished round is pushed up into a staircase of the word; a cream `stop` key (`yours`) is never pressed
//
// Only three things ever change the picture, and each is the same composition enlarged: round 5 (151.73) and
// round 9 (155.42) one step each; in round 12 (158.19) the word takes the whole frame, torn along one horizontal
// cut into two halves out of register, the staircase is pushed out of the top and the counter overflows.
// From round 9 on there is one tear per round; its pattern holds for its full six frames.
//
// Every time here comes from the beat grid (Bt): the LRC runs about 0.4 s early through this passage.
