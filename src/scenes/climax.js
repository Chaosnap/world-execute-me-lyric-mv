// THE CLIMAX (v4), 162.81-192.34 s: what the last chorus (12_chorusx.js) and the four LOVE lines (12_outro.js,
// plates_love.js) share. From 162.81 s the film is plates only: no composer, no header, no pointer at work.
//
// Two things escalate, and they never peak in the same frame:
//   CORRUPTION (the first half)  the three ink plates are out of register (a thin red plate shows at one edge), and
//                                on every kick ONE fault: the plates spring apart, the sheet tears, the colours part,
//                                a few blocks of mosaic; six frames, then the sheet is clean again. Never a low
//                                frame rate: every move in this stretch runs at the full rate (fix round)
//   LIGHT (the second half)      a RATCHET: its level is set by a cut, the start of a keyword or a syllable; inside a
//                                shot it only goes up and it comes down on cuts. On top of it (fix round): one flash
//                                that falls back on the strong beat of each chorus keyword, a bloom that breathes
//                                with the bass, and the white-out at 177.57 s. Never more than one falling flash a beat
//
//   PAL          the state of the whole stretch (config.json: the dark ground of `error`, orange and cream of `warm`)
//   expose()     the light of a frame from ONE number, its level
//   figureStage() the three figure shots of the last chorus: the silhouette as a base plate that stands, and the
//                layers that move behind it and on it (world(), sunburst(), livePlates(), inkScreen(), sungLines(),
//                tearSheet(), mosaicBlocks())
//   figure()     her, printed from her three plates m px out of register, the red plate under the orange one
//   caption()    the caption band: one place and one size for the whole stretch; the band itself may tear
//   strip()      the band of black ink across the foot of a plate that a keyword stands on
//   stutter()    THE STUCK WORD: printed in three passes on its three syllables
//   HEART …      the algebraic curve (x² + y² − 1)³ − x²y³ = 0 itself, as points; where a tangent leaves it
